Effective late February 2015 the assets of Ralph E. Davis Associates, Inc. were sold to Opportune LP, a Houston based firm providing financial and accounting consulting services to the energy industry.  Opportune wished to add upstream engineering services to its portfolio at that time so the owners of the Ralph E. Davis firm agreed to the asset sale of the firm originally founded in 1924.

The stock ownership of the Davis firm remained with the previous owners of the Davis firm who changed the name of the company to Reserve Analysts Associates, Inc., in order to maintain a presence for post-closing business such as regulatory filings and to pursue collections from certain delinquent clients.  Presently this company is under the ownership of Allen C. Barron, P.E., previously the president of Ralph E. Davis Associates, Inc.
